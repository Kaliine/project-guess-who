# Project Guess Who Game

The project task was to create my own digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?
I was handed a starter code were the HTML and styling was set up and also some JavaScript functions. 
My main focus was to finish the JavaScript code to make the game work. 


## The problem

I started by reading the starter code. This was challenging to me as a JavaScript beginner, so I had to study hard. 
I also draw a game plan to visualise every step included in the game, from the computer and from the player. This made it easier to think of all the logical steps when coding.
With the help from course mates and the study material I managed to complete the task.
If I had more time I would like to include a timer for the game and it would have been fun to change the characters to some other theme.
