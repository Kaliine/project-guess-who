# Project Guess Who Game

The project task was to create my own digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?
I was handed a starter code were the HTML and styling was set up and also some JavaScript functions. 
My main focus was to finish the JavaScript code to make the game work. 


## The problem

The challenging part of this project was to get used to reading the starter JavaScript code. It was difficult as a JavaScript beginner.
To complete the project, I had to start by drawing a game plan to visualise every step included in the game, from the computer and from the player. This made it easier to think of all the logical steps when coding.
If I had more time I would like to include a timer for the game and it would have been fun to change the characters to some other theme.
